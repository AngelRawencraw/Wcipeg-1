# Wcipeg/Java
I learned to program the basics of Java with my FRC 1360 team.
(First Robotic) Now, I go to Scarbourough every week for Olympiads School for Junior Contest Level 1. I will finish this
course by the end of this year. 
Here, I have two examples of the types of coding I learn. Currently, I am working on data structures such as maps, trees, 
2D arrays, etc. I also practice questions on Wcipeg. (Total of 70 points. )
